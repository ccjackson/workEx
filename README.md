My section from a project that a client needed that allowed them to auto-generate Cleary Reports. My section focused on creating boxes where the Client would be able to list and describe the safety programs at their institution. For example, if the client has 3 safety programs they would enter 3 into the box and hit submit. At this point 6 boxes would be created, 3 narrow boxes (for the program name) and 3 bigger boxes (for the program description), with 1 narrow box being placed on top of a larger box. 

Code snippets that i created are also included
